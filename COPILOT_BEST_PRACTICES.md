## üéØ General Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompts

```
// Specific and contextual
"Create a weather service that integrates with OpenWeatherMap API, includes retry logic, and handles rate limiting"

// Includes domain context
"Implement a Blazor component for displaying weather forecasts with emoji icons and responsive design"

// Specifies constraints
"Generate unit tests for WeatherService using xUnit, mocking HTTP calls, and testing error scenarios"
```

#### ‚ùå Poor Prompts

```
// Too vague
"Create a service"

// Missing context
"Make it work"

// No constraints
"Add tests"
```

### Progressive Development Approach

1. **Start with Interfaces**: Define contracts first
2. **Implement Core Logic**: Focus on business logic
3. **Add Error Handling**: Include resilience patterns
4. **Generate Tests**: Create comprehensive test suites
5. **Document**: Auto-generate documentation

### Context Optimization

- **Use descriptive variable names**: Helps Copilot understand intent
- **Add inline comments**: Explain business logic and constraints
- **Structure code logically**: Follow consistent patterns
- **Include examples**: Show expected input/output formats

## üîß Copilot Instructions Optimization

### Project-Specific Guidelines

```markdown
# Effective .copilot-instructions.md Structure

## Project Context

- Brief description of the application
- Technology stack and versions
- Key business domain concepts

## Coding Standards

- Language-specific conventions
- Framework patterns to follow
- Error handling approaches
- Testing strategies

## Domain Rules

- Business logic constraints
- Data validation requirements
- Integration patterns
- Performance considerations

## Examples

- Code snippets showing preferred patterns

- Common use cases and solutions
```

### Dynamic Instructions

Update instructions as your project evolves:

```markdown
## Current Sprint Focus

- Feature: Weather alerts system
- Priority: Performance optimization
- Tech debt: Migrate to new API version

## Temporary Guidelines

- Use new AlertService pattern for notifications
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Maintain backward compatibility
```

---

## üíª Code Generation Strategies

### Incremental Development

#### Step 1: Define Structure

```csharp
// Start with interface definition
"Create an interface for weather alert service with methods for managing user preferences and sending notifications"
```

#### Step 2: Basic Implementation

```csharp
// Implement core functionality
"Implement WeatherAlertService with in-memory storage and basic notification logic"
```

#### Step 3: Add Resilience

```csharp
// Enhance with production patterns
"Add retry logic, circuit breaker, and structured logging to WeatherAlertService"
```

#### Step 4: Optimize

```csharp
// Performance improvements
"Optimize WeatherAlertService for high throughput with caching and batch processing"
```

### Context-Aware Generation

#### Provide Rich Context

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Processes weather alerts for multiple cities simultaneously
/// Must handle rate limits (1000 requests/hour) and prioritize severe weather
/// Should use Redis for caching and Application Insights for monitoring
/// </summary>
public class WeatherAlertProcessor
{
    // Copilot will generate implementation following these constraints
}
```

#### Use Meaningful Names

```csharp
// Good: Copilot understands the intent
public async Task<WeatherAlert[]> GetSevereWeatherAlertsForUserLocationAsync(string userId)

// Poor: Vague intent
public async Task<object[]> GetDataAsync(string id)
```

---

## üß™ Testing with Copilot

### Test Generation Strategies

#### Comprehensive Test Suites

```csharp
// Generate tests with specific requirements
"Create comprehensive unit tests for WeatherAlertService including:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions (API failures, network timeouts)
- Edge cases (empty responses, malformed data)
- Performance tests for batch processing
- Integration tests with Redis cache"
```

#### Test Data Builders

```csharp
// Request structured test data
"Create a test data builder for WeatherAlert objects with fluent API for setting up different scenarios like severe storms, heat waves, and winter weather"
```

#### Parameterized Tests

```csharp
// Generate data-driven tests
"Create parameterized tests for weather condition emoji mapping covering all weather types from OpenWeatherMap API"
```

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Names**: Use descriptive, behavior-focused names
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow clear test structure
3. **Mock Strategies**: Consistent mocking patterns
4. **Test Categories**: Organize tests by type (unit, integration, performance)

## üìñ Documentation Automation

### API Documentation

#### XML Documentation

```csharp
// Request comprehensive documentation
"Add complete XML documentation to WeatherService including parameter descriptions, return values, exceptions, and usage examples"
```

#### README Generation

```markdown
// Update project documentation
"Update README.md to include:

- New weather alert features
- API configuration steps
- Deployment instructions
- Performance benchmarks"
```

### Architecture Documentation

#### Mermaid Diagrams

```
"Create a sequence diagram showing the weather alert notification flow from trigger detection to user notification delivery"
```

#### Decision Records

```
"Create an ADR documenting the decision to use Redis for alert caching instead of in-memory storage"
```

---

## üë• Team Collaboration

### Shared Copilot Instructions

#### Team-Level Guidelines

```markdown
# Team .copilot-instructions.md

## Code Review Standards

- All public methods must have XML documentation
- Error handling must include structured logging
- Integration tests required for external APIs
- Performance tests for operations >100ms

## Team Conventions

- Use record types for DTOs
- Implement IDisposable for resource management
- Follow repository pattern for data access
- Use options pattern for configuration
```

#### Project Templates

```csharp
// Consistent project structure
"Create a new microservice following our team template with:
- Health checks
- Application Insights integration
- Structured logging
- Configuration management
- Docker support"
```

### Knowledge Sharing

#### Code Examples Library

```csharp
// Document common patterns
"Create examples showing how to implement:
- Retry policies with Polly
- Circuit breakers for external APIs
- Custom telemetry with Application Insights
- Integration testing with TestContainers"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Secure Code Generation

#### Input Validation

```csharp
// Request security-focused code
"Create a weather data validator that sanitizes user input, prevents injection attacks, and validates geographic coordinates"
```

#### Secrets Management

```csharp
// Secure configuration handling
"Implement configuration management for weather API keys using Azure Key Vault with proper error handling and fallback strategies"
```

### Security Reviews

#### Automated Security Checks

```
// Security-focused prompts
"Review this weather service implementation for security vulnerabilities including:
- Input validation issues
- SQL injection risks
- API key exposure
- Data sanitization problems"
```

---

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### Efficient Prompting

#### Batch Operations

```
// Combine related requests
"Generate a complete weather service including interface, implementation, unit tests, and documentation in one session"
```

#### Iterative Refinement

```
// Build incrementally
1. "Create basic weather service interface"
2. "Add error handling to the interface"
3. "Include caching methods"
4. "Add monitoring capabilities"
```
