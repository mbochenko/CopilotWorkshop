### Step 2: Add Comprehensive Unit Tests

1. Generate tests for the resilient client:

   ```text
   Generate comprehensive unit tests for the API client created in the previous step.
   
   Test scenarios to cover:
   
   **Happy Path:**

   - Deserialization works correctly
   - Correlation IDs are logged
   
   **Retry Logic:**

   - Exponential backoff delays are correct
   - Eventually succeeds after retries
   - Fails after max retries exceeded
   
   **Rate Limiting:**
   - HTTP 429 triggers retry-after delay
   - Retry-after header is respected
   - Rate limit recovery works correctly
   
   **Circuit Breaker:**
   - Opens after 5 consecutive failures
   - Rejects requests when open
   - Transitions to half-open after timeout
   - Closes after successful request in half-open state
   
   **Timeout Handling:**
   - Request timeout after 30 seconds
   - Total timeout after 90 seconds
   - Cancellation token propagation
   
   **Error Handling:**
   - Network failures handled gracefully
   - Invalid JSON responses handled
   - HTTP error codes (400, 404, 500, 503) handled
   - Null/empty responses handled
   
   **Logging:**
   - Success logged with correlation ID
   - Failures logged with details
   - Retry attempts logged
   - Circuit breaker state changes logged
   
   Use:
   - xUnit or NUnit for test framework
   - Moq for mocking HttpMessageHandler
   - FluentAssertions for assertions
   - Bogus for test data generation
   
   Create comprehensive test file in Tests/Services/[ClientName]Tests.cs.
   Include setup, teardown, and helper methods.

   9. Security considerations
   10. Rollout plan
   
   Give me a comprehensive implementation plan first.
   Wait for my approval before implementing anything.
   ```

1. Review the implementation plan.

1. Approve specific phases to implement:

   ```text
   Implement Phase 1 of the plan you created.
   
   Follow TDD approach:
   1. Write failing tests first
   2. Implement minimum code to pass tests
   3. Refactor for quality
   
   Show me:
   - Tests written (RED phase)
   - Implementation (GREEN phase)
   - Refactoring improvements (REFACTOR phase)
   
   Include:
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Logging and telemetry
   - Performance optimization
   - Security best practices
   
   Proceed with Phase 1 implementation.

## Verification and Review

### Step 14: Comprehensive Testing

1. Run all tests and verify implementation:

   ```text
   Run comprehensive test suite and generate quality report.
   
   Execute:
   1. All unit tests with coverage report
   2. All integration tests
   3. Performance benchmarks
   4. Security scans
   5. Code quality analysis
   
   Generate report including:
   - Test results summary (passed/failed/skipped)
   - Code coverage percentage (target: >80%)
   - Performance benchmark results
   - Security scan findings
   - Code quality metrics
   
   Identify any:
   - Failing tests (with root cause)
   - Coverage gaps (untested code)
   - Performance regressions
   - New security vulnerabilities
   - Code quality regressions
   
   Provide actionable recommendations for improvements.
   Generate report in docs/quality/test-report.md.
   ```

1. Review the comprehensive test report.

### Step 15: Final Code Review

1. Perform final code review:

   ```text
   Perform a final comprehensive code review of all changes made in this lab.
   
   Review checklist:
   
   **Code Quality:**
   - [ ] Follows project coding standards
   - [ ] Proper naming conventions

   - Recommendations for improvements
   - Overall quality assessment
   
   Generate final review report in docs/quality/final-review.md.
   ```

1. Review the final assessment.

## Best Practices for Advanced Copilot Usage

### Advanced Prompting Strategies

â **Effective Techniques:**

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up prompts
2. **Context Loading**: Provide relevant code context before asking for changes
3. **Constraint Setting**: Explicitly state requirements, patterns, and limitations
4. **Template Usage**: Create reusable prompt templates for common tasks
5. **Multi-Phase Approach**: Break complex tasks into logical phases
6. **Verification Loops**: Always ask Copilot to verify and test its output
7. **Documentation First**: Generate architecture docs before implementation
8. **Comparative Analysis**: Ask for multiple approaches before choosing one

### When to Use vs. Not Use Copilot

â **Use Copilot For:**
- Boilerplate code generation
- Test case generation
- Documentation creation
- Refactoring suggestions
- Code review and analysis
- Performance optimization ideas
- Security vulnerability scanning
- API client implementation

â **Don't Rely on Copilot For:**
- Business logic decisions
- Architecture decisions (use as assistant, not decision maker)
- Critical security implementations (always verify)
- Complex algorithms (verify correctness)
- Production secrets or credentials
- Final deployment decisions

### Advanced Workflow Tips

1. **Version Control Integration**: Commit before major Copilot-assisted changes
2. **Review Everything**: Never blindly accept generated code
3. **Test Immediately**: Run tests after each generation
4. **Document AI Assistance**: Note when Copilot helped in commit messages
5. **Learn from Outputs**: Study generated code to improve your skills
6. **Combine with Research**: Use Copilot + documentation together
7. **Pair Programming**: Use Copilot as a pairing partner, not a replacement

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Copilot Generates Incorrect Code

**Solution:**

```text
The code you generated has [specific issue]. Let's fix it.

Requirements:
- [Describe what the code should actually do]
- [List specific constraints]
- [Mention any patterns to follow]

Please:
1. Analyze why the previous implementation was wrong
2. Propose a corrected solution
3. Explain the key differences
4. Add tests to prevent this issue
5. Show me the fixed code
```

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Solution:**

```text
Analyze the performance impact of recent changes.

Compare:
- Benchmark results before changes
- Benchmark results after changes
- Identify performance regressions
- Explain root causes
- Propose optimizations

For each regression:
- Show the problematic code
- Explain why it's slower
- Provide optimized version
- Show performance improvement
- Verify correctness maintained
```

### Issue: Test Coverage Decreased

**Solution:**

```text
Code coverage has decreased from [X]% to [Y]%. Identify gaps and add tests.

Analyze:
- Which files/methods lost coverage
- Why coverage decreased
- What scenarios are untested

Then:
- Generate comprehensive tests for uncovered code
- Ensure edge cases are covered
- Add integration tests if needed
- Verify coverage improves to at least [X]%

Show me the coverage report and new tests.
```
